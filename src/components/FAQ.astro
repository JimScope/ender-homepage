        question: "Is Ender really free?",
        answer: "Yes. Ender is open source and free to self-host. You only pay for your own infrastructure (server, SIM cards, etc). No per-message fees, no hidden costs.",
    },
    {
        question: "What devices can I use?",
        answer: "Any Android phone with a SIM card works. We also support USB modems. The older the phone, the better — repurpose that drawer full of old phones.",
    },
    {
        question: "How many messages can I send?",
        answer: "As many as your carrier allows. Ender doesn't impose limits. Just be mindful of carrier restrictions and don't spam.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a hosted version?",
        answer: "We offer a managed cloud version if you don't want to self-host. Same features, we handle the infrastructure. Check out the Dashboard for pricing.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use this for marketing/bulk SMS?",
        answer: "Technically yes, but please don't. Ender is designed for transactional messages: OTPs, notifications, alerts. Carriers will block you if you spam.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I contribute?",
        answer: "Check out our GitHub repo! We welcome PRs, bug reports, and feature requests. Join our Telegram to chat with other contributors.",
